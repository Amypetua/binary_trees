# 0x1D. C - Binary tree

This repository contains solutions to alx team project on binary tree. This project will expose the students to understand how to oraganise and store data efficiently.

# what is Binary Tree
A binary tree is a type of data structure used in computer science to organize and store data efficiently. It consists of nodes connected by edges, forming a hierarchical structure. Each node in a binary tree can have at most two child nodes, referred to as the left child and the right child. 

# Types of Binary
(1) full binary tree (2) complete binary tree (3) perfect binary tree (4) balanced binary tree (5) binary search tree

# Difference between binary tree and binary tree search
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. There are no specific rules or constraints on the values stored in the nodes of a binary tree. Nodes can be arranged in any order. WHILE
A binary search tree is a type of binary tree that follows a specific ordering property.
In a binary search tree, for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
The binary search tree property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n) on average (where n is the number of nodes).

# we can calculate binary tree using the following:
1. Depth: Number of edges from the root to a specific node.
2. Height: Number of edges from a node to the furthest leaf node.
3. Height of the Tree: Height of the root node, the maximum height in the tree.
4. Size: Total number of nodes in the tree.

# Requirements
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.

2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

3. All your files should end with a new line.

4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.

5. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

6. You are not allowed to use global variables.

7. No more than 5 functions per file.

8. You are allowed to use the standard library.

9. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples.

10. The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h.

11. Don’t forget to push your header file.

12. All your header files should be include guarded.
